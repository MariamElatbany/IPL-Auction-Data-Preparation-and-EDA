# IPL Auction Data Cleaning and EDA

## Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IPL Auction dataset with a strong focus on data cleaning and understanding price distributions.

## Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning (fixing data types, handling inconsistencies)
- Handling Missing Values
- Feature Engineering (Sold column)
- Outlier Detection using Boxplots
- Price Distribution Analysis
- Visual Analysis using Boxplots and Scatter Plots

## Key Insights
- Majority of players were unsold
- Sold players often have prices close to base price
- Presence of extreme outliers representing star players
- Base price alone does not explain final auction price

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
